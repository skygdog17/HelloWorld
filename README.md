Yo! It's your girl, Mo!
I REALLY want to own a Siberian Husky one day or an Alaskan Malamute (I think that's how you spell it).
I love reading even though I've been slacking in reading casually for the past year. I, however, can still get really into it.
Even though it's not my favorite thing to eat, I never get tired of eating pizza.
My heart truely lies with donuts. They're PERFECT!
